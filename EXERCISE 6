EXERCISE 6

Take the following Python code that stores a string:
str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the
colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted
string into a floating point number

# Given string
text = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'

# To find the position of the colon character
colon_pos = text.find(':')

# Extract the portion of the string after the colon
extracted_str = text[colon_pos + 1:]

# Convert the extracted string to a floating-point number
conf_value = float(extracted_str)

# Print the result
print(conf_value)

out put

0.8475

Process finished with exit code 0
