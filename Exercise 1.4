PYTHON: EXERCISE 1.14
Presentation made by IROHA EMMANUEL 

1. What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer ? 
Ans= C. Store Information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle 

2. What is a program?
Ans= A program are stored instructions 

3. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter? 
Ans= A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file and then it runs a process to translate the high level source code into machine language and then puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution 
       While 
An interpreter directly reads the source code of the program, parse the source code and interprets the instruction on a fly 

4. Which of the following contains ‘machine code’ 
Ans= C. Python source file 

5. What is wrong with the following code:
>>> peimt ‘hello world!’
      File ‘’(stdm)’’, line 1
      Primt ‘hello world!’
     SyntaxError: Invalid syntax 
>>>
Ans= Syntax Error: incorrect syntax rule and incorrect spelling 
             Correction 
>>> print (‘hello world!’) 

6. Where in the computer is a variable such as ‘’x’’ stored after the following python line finished 
X=123
Ans= B. Main memory 

7. What will the following program print out 
X=43
X= x-1
Print (x)
Ans= B. 42 
          Since x= 43 the x= 43-1=42

8. Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:
CPU, main memory, secondary memory, input device, out device 
Ans= * the CPU is like the human brain that is always ready to receive information 
* The main memory that part of the brain that stores information in the brain 
* The secondary memory as humans refers to documented files or words e.g books 
* Input is the information we receive or things we see, learn or read
* Output is processed input for example leaning how to drive and the output is becoming an actual driver that is showing results 
* 
9. How do you fix a ‘’syntax error’’ 
Ans= By debugging, putting this 4 things into consideration 
* reading your program to know where the error is 
* Running 
* Ruminating 
* And retreating.
